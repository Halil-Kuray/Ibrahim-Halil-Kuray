      ## Web Developer


      I am a disciplined and hardworking developer with a passion for learning
      new things. I am highly adaptable to new situations and thrive in
      environments where I can work collaboratively with others. With a
      background in political science and public management, I have a unique
      perspective on the role of technology in society and am able to analyze
      its impact with a critical eye. I work effectively in teams, bringing my
      adaptability and communication skills to collaborate and deliver
      successful projects.
